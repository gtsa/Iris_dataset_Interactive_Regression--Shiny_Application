# Iris dataset Interactive Regression - Shiny Application
This project builds an interactive tool that, based on the *iris* dataset,
would predicts the width of the sepals/petals given their corresponding length.

The project was carried out as a final (peer-reviewed) assignment  within the Coursera course [Developing Data Products](http://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products/) of the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) in January 2020
